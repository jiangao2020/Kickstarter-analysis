The Outcomes Based on Goals line chart shows that there is no canceled project in any goal range. The projets with goal range less than $1000 have the highest successful rate as 76%. The projects with goal range from $45000 to $49999 have the higest failed rate as 100%. However, the projects with goal range from $15000 to $19999 have same successful and failed rate. Therefore, the analysis shows that the higher goal trends to result in failed outcomes, and the lower goal has the opposite outcomes.
