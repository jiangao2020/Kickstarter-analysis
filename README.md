Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
![Outcomes Based on Goals](https://github.com/jiangao2020/Kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Outcomes%20Based%20on%20Goals.png)
The Outcomes Based on Goals line chart shows that there is no canceled project in any goal range. The projets with goal range less than $1000 have the highest successful rate as 76%. The projects with goal range from $45000 to $49999 have the higest failed rate as 100%. However, the projects with goal range from $15000 to $19999 have same successful and failed rate. Therefore, the analysis shows that the higher goal trends to result in failed outcomes, and the lower goal has the opposite outcomes.

![Outcomes Based on Launch Dates](https://github.com/jiangao2020/Kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Outcomes%20Based%20on%20Launch%20Date.png)
The Outcines Based on Launch Date line chart shows that the most successful Kickstarter theater campaigns were started in May, which has 111 successful projects. In the other hand, December has the lowest number of successful projects, which does not seem like a good time to launch a campaign. 

The analysis is based on the campaign goals and the theater launch date. However, different subcategories in different counties might shows various campaign outcomes. We need to preform analysis to have more tables and graphs based on the geography.
